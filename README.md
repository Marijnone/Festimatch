# How to install

#### Windows 
I strongy recommend to use bash on windows this makes development alot easier and alows you to run linux on windows which is great check the tutorial out here http://techgenix.com/bash-on-windows-10/ 



1. create a directory for the repo ``` mkdir Festimatch ```
2. navigate to the folder
3. git clone https://github.com/Marijnone/be-assessement.git
4. inside the folder run ```npm install ```

## .env file 
create .env file
Inside the .env file you put
* DB_HOST=localhost
* DB_USER=youruser
* DB_NAME=Festimatch
* DB_PASSWORD=yourmysqlpassword
* SESSION_SECRET=your session secret

## Mysql 
 1. this webapp is using Mysql so if you do not have mysql installed run this comment in bash: ```apt-get install mysql``` configure       your account. 
 
 * Type sudo service mysql start 
 * Then login to your server using: mysql -u root -p 
 * Run the sql statement to create the DB
 ```
    CREATE TABLE `gebruiker` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `username` text CHARACTER SET utf8,
  `email` text CHARACTER SET utf8,
  `hash` text CHARACTER SET utf8,
  `geslacht` text CHARACTER SET utf8,
  `voorkeur1` text CHARACTER SET utf8,

  `festival` varchar(45) DEFAULT NULL,
  `profileimage` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  `gebruikercol` varchar(45) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
 
 
 ```
 3. please dont forget to add your .env file to your gitignore ‚Äº

## How to start

* There are three command needed to start the webapp
* first inside your bash start your mysql server with ````sudo service mysql start```
